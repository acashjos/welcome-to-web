Hey,
I've been thinking about it through this week and here are my proposals.
Here I am assuming the students have basic idea of how web apps work or a CS background, know SQL, or any programming language.
Without any of these, its impossible to teach all up to react in 10 weeks.
To have a complete project, the student need to get an idea about a backend server, a database and a front-end app.
We can go with  nodeJS + Koa + MySQL/MongoDB for the backend and cover just basics and whatever is necessary for the project completion.
I'd recommend MySQL for DB since at least the CS students will be familiar with the basics of queries. With mongo we'll have to start from zero.

The entire program would look something like this.
week 1 -> Basics concepts like server-client model, HTTP, REST, How web-pages and browsers work, What is Javascript, JSON, node so on.
week 2 -> Koa basics, Database basics, make it work with node, create a simple REST server that read and write data.
week 3 -> Getting deep into things like project structure, project dependencies, npm modules, package.json, common modules and tools used in projects
week 4 -> put together all of these, create a proper web server with different routes and commonly used features
week 5 to 8 -> front end stuff, getting to speed with react + redux
week 9,10 -> put together a simple app using all of these. This could be a shopping cart or messaging app or twitter clone something like that.

These are all little vague at this point.
